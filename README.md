## My Project

**I chose Jersey City Oct 2020 data.  I wanted to try a small sample and then eventiually hoping to expand to a larger data set for various months, years, NYC data etc now that I have the foundatoin viz set up** 

*These are the following Visualizations I did (that includes 2 dashboards and a Story)
TripGenderReport
MostBusiestStartStation
MostBusiestEndStation
10LeastUsedStartStations
BirthYearofMaxTripsBikers
Customer/Subscriber
Oct1st-BikewithMaxtrips
Oct6th-BikewithMaxtrips
Oct12th-BikewithMaxtrips
AvgTripDurationByAge
BikeTripAverage
BikesMostLikelyProneForRepair
UserTypeByStartStation
Top 10 Start stations by Tripdistance and Number of Bikes

BikesUsage+WhoToMarket-StoryOct2020* 

* Unexpected Phenomenon*
1. Age - In my opinion I would have expected more youth to be the bike riders but for the month of October 2020, Jersey City bike data, it was totally not so and seems more riders are in theie 40/50s, as shown in the BirthYearofMaxTripsBikers viz.
2. Some  bikes get rode on more often than others and I would have thought it would be a uniform rotation as they would all be similar.  So its not clear how riders would pick their bikes, or maybe because of the COVID pandemic, bikers opted to go on the same bikes,  as shown in the BikesMostLikelyProneForRepair viz.


**Finally, my story/trends/observations**
I tried to cover 2 Dasboards
1. Start station usages - this should help Citi officials to target on purchasing more bikes in the highly populated stations based on the usage
2.  UserBackground Dashboard - this should help in Citi officials to target on new types of Campaigns based on the Age/Gender that the charts show and to target age based fun programs/deals for more of the other age groups to become subscribers as well
I tried to cover User stories within the same file :
1. Bike usage trend within the month (with weekly data) on what bikes were most used and then a final summary to show the most used bikes, so the Citi officials can finfd what to repair.
2. Part 2 of the story shows some charts to help Citi officials on how to make more customers to be subscribers and whom to target (age/gender)
